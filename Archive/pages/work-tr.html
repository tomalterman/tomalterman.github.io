  <h3>Brief</h3>
  <p>
    At TrialReach we make it simple, clear and quick for patients to get in touch with researchers, so that new drugs and life-changing treatments can reach the people who need them faster.
  </p>
  <p>
    The major problem was that few patients were getting in touch with researchers once they had landed on a study page. We knew that most people would not be interested, but suspected that the design and experience of the process was putting off some people who were interested.
  </p>
  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    The first step was to analyse our analytics and see the drop-off rates at each step. I also started capturing more user behaviour so we could see which parts of the page people interacted with and how far down they scrolled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Noticing that the majority of our users came from tablets and mobiles, I acquired four devices which covered more than 90% of our users and went through extensive testing to fix any usability issues.
  </p>
  <p>
    It was clear that there were more fundamental issues with the experience, so I began doing user testing sessions with patients with various conditions to understand how they interacted with our site. I also researched the information that was most crucial to patients when evaluating clinical trials and compared it to the content we had on the page.
  </p>
  <p>
    These insights allowed us to prototype a way of displaying the information that was simpler, more informative and easier to use. After several rounds of testing we began implementing this new, fully-responsive approach.
  </p>
  <h3>Deliverables</h3>
  <p>
    As well as managing this product and leading the team developing building the solution, I also delivered:
  </p>
  <ul class="ul">
    <li>
      Quantitative analysis of user behaviour
    </li>
    <li>
      A new analytics platform implementation with better metrics of success
    </li>
    <li>
      Qualitative evaluation from user testing
    </li>
    <li>
      Personas of key user groups
    </li>
    <li>
      Detailed user journeys
    </li>
    <li>
      Sketches and wireframes where required
    </li>
  </ul>
