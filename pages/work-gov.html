  <h3>Brief</h3>
  <p>
    One of the largest UK government departments was working on a transaction decision-support platform that could process vast sets of data and automatically flag fraudulent transactions based on a complex risk scoring system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The problem was that this very complex system was very difficult to understand or control effectively. Operational managers needed fine-grained controls, the ability to drill down individual transactions, as well as a high level understanding of what was going on.</p>
    <p>
With this being an experimental platform, they also needed to clearly demonstrate how the platform worked and what it's benefits were to secure further funding.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was in charge of designing and delivering an intuitive user interface that would solve all these user needs.
  </p>
  <h3>Details</h3>
  <p>
    As no one on the project could explain in simple terms what the platform did, my first task was to get a clear and simple definition of the product and its benefits over their current process. This was acheived through several workshops in which I got senior team members to explain how it worked using high level sketches. I was able to map out how an end user's work would be improved by using this platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    This allowed me to understand what the key benefits were and therefore what needed to be communicated to the end user. Equally as important, it allowed me to understand what complexity could be removed or deprioritized.
  <p>
    To ensure quick feedback loops between the business and the developers, I ran collaborative design session at the start of each sprint with all key stakeholders. I also included developers in user testing session to see people's feedback directly.
  </p>
</p>
<p>
  This allowed me to focus on the key user journeys and prototyping the most important  aspects of the new site.
</p>
<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>
  My key deliverables were:
</p>
<ul class="ul">
  <li>
    Prioritised list of user stories
  </li>
  <li>
    User journeys for all main user tasks
  </li>
  <li>
    Paper and HTML prototypes of key journeys
  </li>
  <li>
    User Testing evaluations of features
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  An example of the work produced can be seen in the following presentation:

<h3>Outcomes</h3>
<p>
  The outcomes of this work were:
</p>
<ul class="ul">
  <li>
    a complete redesign of the site focussing on core user needs
  </li>
  <li>
    a refocus on corporate clients who were identified as our most important users
  </li>
  <li>
    significant increase in user satisfaction in qualitative testing
  </li>
</ul>
